# ServerAI

ServerAI was the first project i undertook with java (outside of college). 
It is a minecraft Bukkit plugin which allowed Minecraft players to speak to the server as if it was a living entity.
ServerAI was a fairly successful plugin boasting 2000 downloads by the time Bukkit was issued with a `Do Not Distribute Order` by Mojang

While this project is now inactive, I will leave this code up as a demonstration of my Skill-set
